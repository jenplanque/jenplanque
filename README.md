# Hi there, I'm Jen Planque! 👋 
## aka - the 'PNW Programmer'

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate developer with an uber-inquisitive mind, and a keen interest in web development, machine learning, and open-source contributions.


## 🌱 What I'm Currently Working On

- **[E-Commerce API](https://github.com/jenplanque/ecommerce_API)**:
built using Flask, SQLAlchemy, Marshmallow and MySQL, and designed to facilitate the online shopping experience at a local coffee shop that is loosely based on the 1990's - early 2000's sitcom, [FRIENDS](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108778/).

- **Learning**: I am actively engaged in a 6-month Full Stack Software Developer bootcamp where we are currently doing a Front End deep dive into HTML, CSS and JavaScript, just to name a few. 😜
